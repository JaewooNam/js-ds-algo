A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given.

A permutation is a sequence containing each element from 1 to N once, and only once.

For example, array A such that:
```
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
```
is a permutation, but array A such that:
```
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
```
is not a permutation, because value 2 is missing.

The goal is to check whether array A is a permutation.

Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A, returns 1 if array A is a permutation and 0 if it is not.

For example, given array A such that:
```
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
    A[3] = 2
```
the function should return 1.

Given array A such that:
```
    A[0] = 4
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 3
```
the function should return 0.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].


```js
function solution(A) {
  if (A.length > 100000) return -1
  const sortedArr = A.sort((a,b)=>a-b)
  let obj = {}
  for (let val of sortedArr) {
    obj[val] = (obj[val] || 0) + 1    
  }

  for (let i = 1; i <= A.length; i++) {
    if (!obj[i]) {
      return 0
    }
  }

  return 1
}
```
