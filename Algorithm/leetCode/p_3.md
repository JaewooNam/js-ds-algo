### 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

```js
var lengthOfLongestSubstring = function(s) {
  if (!s) return false

  let tmp = []
  let max = -Infinity
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (tmp.indexOf(s[i]) < 0) {
      tmp.push(s[i])
    } else {
      if (tmp.length > max) {
        max = tmp.length
      }
      tmp.push(s[i])
      let idx = tmp.indexOf(s[i])
      tmp = tmp.slice(idx + 1)
    }
  }

  max = Math.max(tmp.length, max)
  return max
}
```
